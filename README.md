# simple_smart_scale

The code in this repo is **not** up to my normal standards from a neatness perspective.  

This repository has contains a simple UI and model training process for a smart scale I made.

It should be installable as a python package. 

you can just clone the repo and `pip install .`

then to run you just need to `python3 start_scale.py` in the CLI from this directory (assuming that's your name for python3 on your system).

The scale tracks weight over time, graphs it, and classifies your trajectory according to research done by Wharton et. al. 

This code is intended to run on a raspberry pi.
