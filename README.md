# simple_smart_scale

This repository has contains a simple UI and model training process for a smart scale I made.

It should be installable as a python package. 

you can just clone the repo and `pip install .`

then to run you just need to `start_scale` or  `start_scale_rpi` in the CLI from this directory. 

The scale tracks weight over time, graphs it, and classifies your trajectory according to research done by Wharton et. al.
